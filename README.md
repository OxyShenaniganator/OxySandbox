# OxySandbox

A 2D sandbox RPG game written in Java, inspired by Pokemon Mystery Dungeon.

Currently still in early development and heavily WIP. 





## Development Build

While the project is still missing various important aspects, you still can test the current state of it by compiling it from source.

Download the repository, then open a shell prompt in that folder or the terminal in your IDE, then type the following:


```bash
  .\gradlew build
```

Once the build is completed, a new jar file will be in `OxySandbox\build\libs\`
